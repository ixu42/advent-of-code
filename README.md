# advent-of-code

Advent of Code (AoC) is a yearly set of programming puzzles released each December since 2015, where participants solve various problems and explore interesting patterns.

This repository contains my AoC solutions from 2023, 2024, and 2025.

It includes puzzle inputs, code for parsing the inputs, generating visualizations where applicable, and implementing problem-solving logic.
